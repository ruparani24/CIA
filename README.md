This graph is directed. Conceptually, the prims graph won't function on a directed weighted network, but in this case, the prims method does work because in this graph, when using the prims method, the nodes don't go to the D node after E node, hence omitting the -5 and satisfying the Prims Method. In other cases, Prim's won't work.
